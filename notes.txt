Different settings create different games. Here's a list of settings:

Binary settings:

Eat:  + = When player lands on a node, one pip is removed before the rest scatter
      - = All existing pips scatter

Bounce:  + = Pips won't be scattered off the edge of the grid
         - = Pips scattered off the edge of the grid are removed completely

Needy:  + = Player may not move onto an empty node
        - = Player may move onto an empty node

Shifty:  + = Every move, one connection is removed, and a new one is added
         - = Connections remain fixed

Sacrifice:  + = Player can move to an adjacent node, empty or not, with or
                    without a connection, at the cost of losing a connection
            - = A connection is required to move between connected nodes, and
	            must comply with "Move to Empty"
